# E-Commerce-Back-End

## Description

An application that allows you to update the backend of an online store.  You can add/delete/update products, categories, and tags based off your requests to the server.  Additionally, you can view specific products/categories/tags by issuing GET requests.

## Usage

Launch the application by running 
```terminal
npm start
```
Then open up the localhost in Insomnia (the localhost used is 3001).  Once the app is open in Insomnia, navigate to the api/ folder which will allow you to navigate to one of three locations: tags, products, categories.  Once you are in one of these endpoints, you can create GET, PUT, POST, DELETE requests to view, update, create new, and delete items from any of these data bases.
